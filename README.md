👋 Hi, I'm Ken

Chemical Lead | Aspiring Software Developer | ERG Co-Lead | Continuous Learner

I’m a driven professional with 5+ years in the chemical and supply chain industry, currently serving as a Chemical Lead for Nalco Water in Bedford Park, IL. Since starting in 2020, I’ve grown from Operator I → Operator III → Lead, taking on responsibilities that strengthened my technical, operational, and leadership skills.

Alongside my role, I serve as the Co-Lead for Chicagoland’s EcoEssence ERG, where I help create community, support professional growth, and connect with leaders across the company.

In 2023, I was honored with Ecolab’s Global Excellence Award, recognizing outstanding performance and commitment to operational excellence. I also hold a CDL Class A license, giving me a strong foundation in logistics and supply chain operations.

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Software Development and building a strong foundation in:

My long-term goal is to transition into the IT and software development space, where I can merge my frontline operations experience with efficient, tech-driven solutions.
